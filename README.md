# Linux tree command implementation in C . 



Simple implementation of "tree" tool, in a long mode, meaning printing the file tree with itâ€™s permitions, user and group, and size.
Meaning this is an implementation for:
```
tree -pugs
```
The default behaviour is to print from current folder moving down the tree
But it works with any legit path.



##### Installation and usage

```
git clone https://github.com/VictoKu1/AP_Ex2.git
cd AP_Ex2
make
./stree
```
